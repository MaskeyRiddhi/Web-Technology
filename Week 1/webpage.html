        <h1 align="center">IBM founder Thomas J.Watson Sr.</h1>
        <p>Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, New York, U.S. He  was a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing equipment used
           today by business, government, science and industry. He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM. He worked his way
           up from a bookkeeper to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto,
           "THINK," which later became a widely known symbol of IBM. For many years Mr. Watson served as a trustee of Columbia University and 
           Lafayette College. He was presented with honorary degrees by 27 colleges and universities in the United States and four abroad.
